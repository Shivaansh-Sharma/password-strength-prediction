# Password Strength Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains research work on password strength prediction and classification using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project investigates the effectiveness of neural architectures for estimating password strength and comparing performance across multiple models using standard evaluation metrics.

## Overview

Weak passwords remain one of the most common cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Traditional rule-based password evaluation systems often fail to capture semantic and structural patterns present in real-world passwords.

This project explores data-driven approaches for password strength classification using machine learning and deep learning models trained on large-scale password datasets.

## Objectives

- Develop models for password strength prediction
- Compare traditional ML and deep learning approaches
- Evaluate model performance using multiple classification metrics
- Analyze ROC performance and confusion matrices
- Investigate practical applications in cybersecurity systems

## Models Used

- Random Forest
- LSTM Neural Network
- Transformer-based Neural Network

## Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
